This one is gonna be pretty short; Expect book essays about the Horus Heresy from Warhammer 40K in the near future. I feel like doing this. We're just gonna spit through the main novels, I recently bought an e-reader and I feel like brushing up on my rusty reading skills.

Gonna start with The Last Church as the opening and then work my way through them as we get there.

That's all, Lucy out.
