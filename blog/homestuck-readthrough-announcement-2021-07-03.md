In the category of ill advised ideas, one that might be considered especially inadvisable is attempting to re-experience a story that is at it's core a contemporary work. These works often carry a lightning in a bottle effect for those who read them. That being said, sometimes it is still worth revisiting these stories, not from the nostalgia lens in which they were created, but rather as a critical piece of analysis to understand where one stands and what one can experience.

With that haughty intro out of the way, I greet you all. This post will be (relatively) short as it is merely an announcement. Specifically, I want to introduce everyone to my next big project, one that has been coming for... frankly about a year now and I'm finally having both the confidence and willingness to self-schedule my own life again to make this a feasible reality.

I will be rereading (and listening) through the entirety of Homestuck. For those of you who are not familiar with Homestuck, allow me to give you an introduction of sorts and also use this as a moment to explain why I will be revisiting it.

## What is Homestuck?

A question that might soon become more relevant as the comic begins to really fade in obscurity (more on the why in a bit), one might ask: What is Homestuck?

Well, to put it simply, Homestuck is a piece of interactive web fiction that started all the way back in 2009. Created by Andrew Hussie, the comic is at a first glance not too dissimilar from similar contemporary webcomics at the time. That said, the key differences that set Homestuck apart from most other webcomics are as follows:

* A heavy use of GIFs, flash animations and website elements to convey stories.
* Early on, a large amount of reader input was taken and used to direct the story, meaning that the story grew along with the way the readers experienced it. This was eventually dropped.

To explain that second one; for pretty much the entirety of it's early runtime, as well as in the creators previous work (Problem Sleuth), there would be a box on the site where readers could submit "commands". Homestuck itself is structured somewhat like an old text adventure game, where the story is primarily moved forward through text commands given to either a character or to the narration itself.

A somewhat fun coincidence is that both of the things that would set it's format apart is by no means actually unique to the webcomic. [Homestar Runner](https://homestarrunner.com) existed for far longer than Homestuck has and had similar heavy use of non-image content (specifically flash animations). 

Similarly, the command input format also existed for a while in a bastardized form on 4chan's /tg/, where it was known as "Quests" (nowadays the format survives on a dedicated board from what I can tell and other places like bay12 have had similar kinds of threads over the years). Unlike the Homestuck approach, Quests would instead rely more on direct reader inputs where the author of the Quest would quickly sketch out the next panel. The very first Quest was known simply as "[Drew the Lich](http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/archive.html?tags=Drew%20the%20lich)", and detailed a story of a Lich named Drew who based on the responses of the /tg/ userbase would get up in various antics with the stated goal of the Lich being to figure out his own "alignment".

The Quest eventually petered out as the artist lost interest. That said, the Quest most people are familiar with instead is [Ruby Quest](http://evilcorporation.com.br/rubyquest/) ([Original /tg/ threads here](http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/collection.html?collnum=0)). Unlike Drew the Lich, Ruby Quest actually had a stated goal and characters (they were borrowed from animal crossing, but the story had it's own direction).

Homestuck's idea of the command box seems to have developed on it's own separately, but it's still just as relevant to mention.

So hopefully this gives you a bit of an idea of what the comic itself is like. We haven't even delved into the myriad of fan content that Homestuck would eventually produce or the internet phenomenon it would eventually become, but don't worry, **we will**.

So with that in mind, let's talk about how this readthrough will be structured.

## Structure

This will be a very... flexible readthrough. I am not keeping myself to a schedule. I will be going through Homestuck at my own pace, at my own time. For the first three Acts (Homestuck's version of arcs in any other story), this will mean that I will be posting summaries on a per act basis as these mostly involve a lot of not... very interesting screwing around as Andrew left a lot of it up to the readers. This will become untenable by Act 4, as by this point, the comic itself will bulk up *severely* in size.

As a result, the structure for that situation will be done (deliberately) as follows:

* Out of practical and focus concerns, my main way of reading Homestuck will be through the [Voxus Let's Read](https://www.youtube.com/c/Voxus/playlists?view=50&sort=dd&shelf_id=2). Some people may find this to be a bad idea. To these people I say: fuck it. Homestuck is extremely long and this is a fairly accurate way to follow the story along without missing a lot. This comes into play for Act 4, where the story begins to size up (and in general lose a lot of it's silliness as by this time Andrew ditches). As a result, I will instead be posting a summary every 5 episodes of the Voxus Let's Read. This might seem sporadic and kinda wide breath, but I need the time to organize my thoughts and this is a fairly nice approach.
* The Voxus Let's Read however is unfinished, and while I could wait for the entire thing to be completed, in practice this would take literal years and frankly this might take literal years as well, so it's better to jump off of it once I simply reach the end of currently available content.
* So, at that point I will jump over to the comic itself. Luckily for me, assuming this doesn't take so long that Voxus literally finishes itself up, this is also the point where Homestuck begins to fracture it's acts back into easily digestible "all at once" chunks, so this will mostly be per Act summaries again, except for the very very end, where I will have to split pieces once again because the comic bulks it's second to last act out to insanity.
* Finally, Intermissions: I plan on having at least for every act an intermission once we finish them up. The reason for this is manyfold but can easily be summarized as: I need a way to talk about Homestuck from a metanarrative perspective (as in, talk about it in a way so you can understand the fandom and what's going on besides the main comic itself) and the actual readthrough is a very daunting task so this gives me time to talk about other things. This will notably include Hussie's earlier work, Problem Sleuth, as well as the content he made before Problem Sleuth. I'm also planning to read Ruby Quest at some point, because there's simply a lot of intermissions to fill. Consider it a palate cleanser, because if you read only Homestuck all the time, you will at some point kinda start going crazy and I don't want that. Not for myself and not for you.

After that I might also look into post-canon content, but since most of it doesn't seem to be very good, we'll have to see. Which brings me to...

## Why read Homestuck?

So why do a Homestuck readthrough at all? Wouldn't it be easier to just let an old corpse be an old corpse? While this is certainly true and a valid argument, there are a few reasons that make it... more than just a casual thing for me.

The first and most direct reason is that Homestuck is one of the few pieces of media that really transformed my life. I was 15 when I read it and I finished it on the very day it ended. After this, the two or so years I really spend being just "a fan" of the webcomic (I may have consumed more AO3 fanfiction than I'd like to admit, Homestuck has a very dedicated fanbase) also helped me connect IRL and even make some of the friends I still care about today. 

As for online, Homestuck was my very first real "online community" for a good while. I joined Discord in part because of it. While I eventually petered out of it and found a real, much kinder, home in the hacking scene, one can't deny that a lot of my learning moments as a kid on how and who to be on the internet outside of a passive consumer can be found in those places (that and the Terraria forums).

Secondly, and this is the kinda ugly reason... Homestuck's creator has been kind of an asshole. I wrote about this [literally two days ago](https://noirscape.dev/blog/rant-about-what-pumpkin-2021-07-01), but What Pumpkin has been getting itself into quite the shitshow ([other more general HS essay that in part touches on this](https://wiki.noirscape.dev/index.php/Essay:Homestuck)). As a result, I am left with a void of where to place this over the years and how to contextualize this with Hussie being an asshole. My hopes is that in re-reading the comic, I am able to fill the uncertain void of what this means.

This also of course means I will be making a deliberate effort to not give Andrew Hussie or any of his goons any money if I can help it. It does not matter too much, given that the comic's site itself is owned by Viz Media, but also because of a botched server transition, the comic more or less didn't survive the death of Flash. To still read Homestuck, I will be perusing the [Unofficial Homestuck Collection](https://bambosh.github.io/unofficial-homestuck-collection/). Win win really, because it contains a lot of other goodies that I want to talk about and is in general the most recommended way to experience the comic in 2021. Much love to those people, give them a go.

And... with that, I have nothing else to really say. Expect an Act update soon-ish I guess, the first few acts of Homestuck are kinda short. It'll be at my own pace though so I might also write about other things. I'll make sure this is all collected under a blog series so you can easily read through these things later.

See ya on the flipside!

## UPDATE AUGUST 2021

Yeah this didn't last long. It's abandoned. Leaving the post up but this one is called off for now.
